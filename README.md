# BME Capstone Rat Depression Team - NAFS Detector
Repo for BME Capstone Rat Depression 

If you haven't used Github before, I recommend installing Github Desktop and cloning this entire repository so you have all the files on your computer.

## GUI Operation
You need both arduino_gui,py and arduino_gui_functions.py. Run the arduino_gui.py file to start the GUI

## Actigraphy
Contains all of the code for visualizing and analyzing data collected by the actigraphy subsystem. The actigraphy_data_acq folder contains the C++ code to put on the Arduino.

## Bitcraze
Arduino library that we use to operate the PMW3901 optical flow sensor
